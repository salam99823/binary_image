A Rust library for handling binary images (black and white).
This library provides efficient structures and operations for
manipulating binary pixel data, making it suitable for image processing tasks.

## Features

- **Binary Pixel Representation**:
  Efficiently represent and manipulate binary pixels
  using `Bit` structure.
- **Conversion**: Easily convert between `bool`, `Bit` types.
- **Image Processing**: Convert pixels to various
  formats such as RGB, grayscale, and more.
- **Trait Implementations**: Implements traits from the `num_traits`
  crate for numeric operations and conversions.
